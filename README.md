# Todo App using React


I wanted to test what i learned so far from react, and this project was perfect for it. I learned some tricks, had fun and i raged.
I didn't really spend that much time on it to make it better but i'm planning on making a MUCH better one in the future.
This is just here to showcase my improvement lol.
